    <h2>What exactly is Warframe?</h2>
    <p>Warframe is free-to-play, third-person shooter that combines RPG elements with a massive online multiplayer experience. 
    It was developed by Digital Extremes and first released on March 25, 2013.</p>
    <p>it’s available on pretty much every platform you can think of: PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
    <p>It’s no surprise the game’s been nominated for awards like The Game Award for Best Ongoing Game—(it’s always evolving with new updates, events, and expansions to keep players hooked!)</p>
    <p>Within the game you play as... you guessed it! <i>Warframes</i>. Now you may ask what is a Warframe? A Warframe is essentially a cyborg shell, think Ironman's suit but way cooler. Below you can see a variety of the playable Warframes.</p>
    <img src="https://d1lss44hh2trtw.cloudfront.net/assets/article/2019/07/18/how-to-create-a-clan-and-invite-others-in-warframe-hero_feature.jpg" alt="1" width="990" height=auto>        
    <p>The Tenno are basically space ninjas with a mysterious past. They’re descendants of the Orokin era—a super-advanced, kind of creepy golden age on Earth, full of high-tech wonders and some messed-up experiments. 
    The Tenno themselves were created as warriors and then put into cryosleep for who knows how long. 
    Now they’ve woken up to a totally different universe, and every faction out there seems to want them gone or under their control.</p>
    <p>As a Tenno, you get to wear Warframes—these insane, bio-mechanical suits with powers that range from summoning fire to controlling time. Each Warframe has its own personality, abilities, and style, 
    so part of the fun is figuring out which suits your vibe. Plus, you’ll be doing everything from stealthy infiltration missions to all-out battles against space grunts, monstrous aliens, and otherworldly threats.</p>
    <p>In a nutshell, the Tenno are the last traces of an ancient warrior culture, and now they’re out in the galaxy, fighting anyone and anything that stands in their way, unlocking old secrets, 
    and just generally being the ultimate badasses of the universe.</p>
    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/9/9d/Operator_and_Umbra.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20230603085753" alt="2" width="620" height=auto>
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/tenno-wtf-is-this-v0-0q3431asrd981.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=969ec095be7d0df3fe1bfb29289f5cf5bd9acaff" alt="3" width="370" height=auto>
    <p>As you can see there is somewhat a special relationship between the teno and warframe,thats because the tenno needs the Warframe to contain their overflowing amonut of power known as void energy.</p>
    <p>If not contained or controlled the void energy would untimatley destroy the tenno from the inside out,the suit of aurmour 
    they wear called a warframe allows the tenno to have control over this energy making it non-harmfull to them.Depending on 
    what warframe the tenno is wearing it gives them special and unique abbilites, the abbilites vary across the different kinds of warframe you use.</p>


    <h3>What to do in the game</h3>
    <p>In the game you have various types of missions they include: Capture, Assaasination, Rescue, Defence, Defection,
    Excavation, Exterminate, Hijack, Sanctuary Onslaught, Spy, Arena, Assault, Infested Salvage, Interception, Dec eption,
    Orikin Sabotage, Disruption, Hive, Skirmish.</p>   
    <p>As you can see there are many missions to choose from, each mission has their own rewards to be gained from it.For example:
    you mainly get the parts to build the warframe from assaasinationmissions, furthermore each planet has materials that are  unique
    to that location, for example: Galium can be found  mainly on Mars and Uranus.</p>      
    <p>Speaking of the wide range of planets you can travel to, some of them have their own 
    player hub where you can comeplete missions to get incerdiabley usefull resources that you would be using very 
    often, you can also aquire warframe parts</p> .
    <p> While at these hubs you can also earn standing from doing missions there which 
    allow you to rank up a tottal of 5 times in said location giving you the opportunitty to buy increasingling rare items from the hub,
    the difficultey of the missions is based on the planets base level of difficultey.</p>

    <p>Those are all the available ranks you can obtain while you are at fortuna </p>
    <p>Solaris United are a rebel group of Solari workers, seeking to liberate their fellow unhappy laborers who work for Nef Anyo
    underground in Fortuna. The Solari possess body augmentations that make them appear as IconCorpusOn Corpus-machine hybrids,
    and are responsible for processing the underground network of IconOrokinOn Orokin terraformation coolant and refining it for 
    use back on the scorched surface of Orb Vallis on Venus.</p>

    <p>As you can probbably tell it is an insane grind to reach rank 5 especially considering the standing the bounties 
    available too you provide very little standing.From the lowest bounty you can gain 1470 standing and from the highest
    and hardest bounty you gan expect to gain  4180.Although  i previously said base level of the planet determins missions
    in the case of the different hubs it depends on the bounty selected, depending on the difficultey of the bounty you select
    it would have a set difficultey.</p>

    <p>The highest bounty enemey was 50-60, and the lowest enemey level is 10-15. As you may choose a differnt level difficulty the  number
    of parts per bounty may vary between 1-5 parts you must comeplete all parts to complete the entire bounty if you leave you leae early
    you will not recive completion rewards.</p> 

    <p>However for each part you comeplete you get part of the total standing reward and some other rewards and such as shelter
    bonds and if you complete the bonus chalenge you get a higher rarity reward per part of the bounty you complete. The only other
    thing i would recomend you to do would be to buy the sunpoint plasma drill from SMOKEFINGER in fortuna as you would need it for

    <p> And those are all the ranks availabe at the cetus </p>
    <p> The Ostrons are the inhabitants of the Cetus settlement near the Plains of Eidolon on Earth. They are a hardy, mercantile people
    that dwell in the shadow of the Orokin Tower of the Unum, which they harvest for their livelihood. Kept safe from Grineer aggression 
    by the arcane powers of the Unum herself, Cetus serves as their central trading hub in the Origin System and a refuge for all others 
    who come to it with peaceful intentions.</p>

    <p>Most of the Information i have stated about the bounties applies here as well the only difference is the rewards you can recive.One 
        thing that makes this place different is that if you were to enter the Plains of Eidolon you would be able to fish,this is a very simple
        mechanic in the game only requiring a fishing rod bait(dependson on the fish you wish to catch) and luminous dye no highlight the fish in 
        the water. Quite zen all you have to do is wait cath the fish bring it back to the cetus and either sell it or cut it open to get materials 
        such as shark teeth  </p>
     
    <p> Althouh overall its the same as Fortuna in terms of missions recntly the added somethimg interesting in introduction to a new warframe releases. 
        They made a little land mark called Koumie's shrine where you can earn the parts nesesary parts for the Koumie warframe.

    <p>You have to collect fate pearls through defence missions available by interacting with the shrine.

    <p>This place is differnt in every concivable way from the rank system to the rank givers to the planet it's slef. To begin with there is not one not 2
        but 5 people you can take up completely different of missions from. 
    </p>

    <p>This place can be considered as weired as the quest givers are all related from left to right it's, the Mother,Father,Daughter,Son and Grandmother.
        Normally when you go through the ranks u mainly just unclock more  mateirals to buy from NPc in said location, now although this is true for thsi 
        location there are more layers. This is because as you unlock more ranks you fix the family delemma between them slowly unraveling why they all 
        seemingly hate eachother. They slowly become functional.
    </p>
    <p> Just before i explain all the missions available to you on thsi free roam hub i wiuld like to mention ussually when you enter the free raom are to go
        minning or fishing there will be npc that attempt to kill you, they are ussually around lvl 10-14. However here at the cambion  drift that number 
        spikes to a disgusting 40-60. Starting to see the problem here?Good.
    </p>



    
    <p>Though i did not mention this b4 at these hubs there is ussaly an introduction mission which arent hard, but as you can guesse this place is not normal. This is more 
        of warning but during this mision in order to complete this mission....you loose everything all of the mods on the warframe useless stripped away and u must complete a
        good portion on about 50hp, oh did i mention u can't run either? like who even needs that.
    </p>


   <p> I plead any readers to heed my warning. DO NOT GO TO THE CABION DRIFT UNLESS ABSOLUTLEY NESSESARY, THAT PLACE IS NOT FOR THE WEAK.
     Even after after becoming a more seasoned player i would not recomend going unless your meele at the minimum can do at least 1000 damage
    per regular slash.Further more make sure you go  with freinds to increase chances of survival,tghe more you can communicate the better 
    and remember you only haev 4 revivals before having to depend on others to bring you back from the brink of death, use them wiseley.</p>

    <p>However if you choose to proceed you will need the information i am about to give you.For example here you dopnt get standing when 
        completing bounties or gathering missions you now get tokens there are 6 in total.</p>

        <h1>Mission/Tokens available </h1>


    <img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/6/67/MotherEntrati.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200802145142" alt='26' width="400" > 
    <img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/f/fe/MotherToken.png/revision/latest?cb=20221215031406" alt='27' width="400" >

    <p>
        Mother, here you can do regular bounties as well as vaults that have extremley high difficulty,if you do choose the vaults i can assure you the value of what 
        you will fiind in there will blow away your expectations.Now another thing that makes  this place so different is that instead of immediatley reciving standing 
        you recive tokens you can then exchange for standing by talking to the Grandmother. The mother token is a bit  small and  has a glow of purple.</p>
    </p>


    <img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/f/f6/FatherEntrati.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200827012126" alt='28' width="400" >
    <img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/c/c7/FatherToken.png/revision/latest?cb=20221215031306" alt='29' width="400" >

    <p>The Father dose not give you bounties but requests you give him certain materials that can found in the cambion drift in exchange for his tokens.
    His token is bigger than the mothers and has a stonger glow of purple.From the Father you can also get different parts for wepons only found in 
    the cambion drift.</p>

    <img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/2/2d/Daughter_New.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220104234824" alt='30' width="400" >
    <img src= "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/5/5a/DaughterToken.png/revision/latest?cb=20221215031251" alt='31' width="400" >

    <p>Now as you might know from reading the table of ranks the Daughter enjoys  collecting fish.She will request you to go out and collect specific 
    fish for her in exchange for her tokens, her token is medium sized and green. The daughter also offers a fishing rod better than the one found 
    on the Plains of Eidolon she also provides bait for the fish of that area.</p>

    <p>Simmiliarly the so is quite interested in the wildlife of the cambion drift, and will ask you to catch all stray mamal like creatures and tag then
     bring them back in exchange for tokens. In the sons case he token is a nice shade of blue .</p>

    <p>Otak just wants you to go out and mine in the cambion drift and brink backl what you get in exchange foir his token.Now this sound like a 
     simole task but NO, the thing he reqjuires you to get are quite rare and you will constantkey chased by things that wont give you space to do 
     what you need to.So i wish you the best of luck out there.</p>

    <p>The Grandmother just wants everyone to get allong and will offer quests in  which you will attempt to get the family to not hate eachother 
        for a change.She is also the person you go to to exchange the Mother tokens for stnading in order to rank up, but for here token you need to 
        exchange different combonations of the other tokens.
